    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">Rmetrics is a 
    collection of several hundreds of functions which may be useful for 
    teaching &quot;Financial Engineering&quot; and &quot;Computational 
    Finance&quot;. These functions are available for R, &#147;GNU&#146;s 
    S&#148;. This is a freely available language and environment for 
    statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of 
    statistical and graphical techniques.</FONT></FONT></P>
   <P>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">The functions have 
    their source in algorithms and functions written by myself, my 
    students, and many other authors. A major aim is to bring financial 
    algorithms and concepts together under a common software platform and 
    to make it public available mainly for teaching financial engineering 
    and computational finance. Rmetrics is not part of <A HREF="http://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</A>,
     Rmetrics is an initiative by its own. Rmetrics has some aims similar 
    like <A HREF="http://www.bioconductor.org">Bioconductor</A>. Rmetrics 
    is an open source and open development software project.</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">The basic R port 
    from which Rmetrics originated was already initiated in 1999 as an 
    outcome of lectures held by Diethelm W&uuml;rtz on topics in 
    econophysics at ETH Z&uuml;rich. Meanwhile, the family of the 
    Rmetrics packages includes four members dealing with the following 
    subjects: <I><B>fBasics</B></I> - Markets, Basic Statistics, Date and 
    Time, <I><B>fSeries</B></I> - The Dynamical Process Behind Financial 
    Markets, <I><B>fExtremes</B></I> - Beyond the Sample, Dealing with 
    Extreme Values, and <I><B>fOptions</B></I> - The Valuation of 
    Options. Two other packages are under current development, <I><B>fBonds</B></I> 
    and <I><B>fPortfolio</B></I>.</FONT></FONT></P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">The package <I><B>fBasics</B></I> 
    covers the management of economic and financial market data. Included 
    are functions to download economic indicators and financial market 
    data from the Internet. Distribution functions relevant in finance 
    are added like the asymmetric stable, the hyperbolic and the inverse 
    normal gaussian distribution function to compute densities, 
    probabilities, quantiles and random deviates. Estimators to fit the 
    distributional parameters are also available. Some additional 
    hypothesis tests for the investigation of correlations, dependencies 
    and other stylized facts of financial time series can also be found 
    in this package. Furthermore, for date and time management a holiday 
    database for all ecclestial and public holidays in the G7 countries 
    and Switzerland is provided together with a database of daylight 
    saving times for financial centers around the world. Special calendar 
    management functions were implemented to create easily business 
    calendars for exchanges. A collection of functions for filtering and 
    outlier detection of high frequency foreign exchange data records 
    collected from Reuters' data feed can also be found together with 
    functions for de-volatilization and de-seasonalization of the data.</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">The package <I><B>fSeries</B></I> 
    covers topics from the field of financial time series analysis 
    including ARIMA, GARCH, Regression, and Feedforward Neural Network 
    modelling. This library tries to bring together the content of 
    existing R-packages with additional new functionality on a common 
    platform. The collection comes with functions for testing various 
    aspects of financial time series, including unit roots, independence, 
    normality of the distribution, trend stationary, co-integration and 
    neglected non-linearities. Furthermore functions for testing for 
    higher serial correlations, for heteroskedasticity, for 
    autocorrelations of disturbances, for linearity, and functional 
    relations are also provided. Technical analysis and benchmarking is 
    another major issue of this package. The collection offers a set of 
    the most common technical trading indicators together with functions 
    for charting and benchmark measurements. For building trading models 
    functions for a rolling market analysis are available. A new 
    additional chapter on modeling long memory behavior including moment 
    methods, periodgram analysis, whittle estimator, and wavelet analysis 
    is planned to be added in the near future.</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">The package <I><B>fExtremes</B></I> 
    covers topics from the field what is known as extreme value theory. 
    The package has functions for the exploratory data analysis of 
    extreme values in insurance, economics, and finance applications. 
    Included are plot functions for empirical distributions, quantile 
    plots, graphs exploring the properties of exceedences over a 
    threshold, plots for mean/sum ratio and for the development of 
    records. Furthermore functions for preprocessing data for extreme 
    value analysis are available offering tools to separate data beyond a 
    threshold value, to compute blockwise data like block maxima, and to 
    de-cluster point process data. One major aspect of this package is to 
    bring together the content of already existing R-packages with 
    additional new functionality for financial engineers on a common 
    platform investigating fluctuations of maxima, extremes via point 
    processes, and the extremal index. A new additional chapter on risk 
    measures, stress testing and copulae is planned to be added in the 
    near future.</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">The package <I><B>fOptions</B></I> 
    covers the valuation of options including topics like the basics of 
    option pricing in the framework of Black and Scholes, including 
    almost 100 functions for exotic options pricing, including the 
    Heston-Nandi option pricing approach mastering stochastic volatility, 
    and Monte Carlo simulations together with generators for low 
    discrepancy sequences. Beside the Black and Scholes option pricing 
    formulas, functions to valuate other plain vanilla options on 
    commodities and futures, and function to approximate American options 
    are also available. Some binomial tree models are implemented. The 
    exotic options part comes with a large number of functions to valuate 
    multiple exercise options, multiple asset options, lookback options, 
    barrier options, binary options, Asian options, and currency 
    translated options. Some functions for the investigation of 
    exponential Brownian motion in the context of Asian option valuation 
    have been recently added.</FONT></FONT></P>

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">Rmetrics has a 
    commitment to full open source code development and distribution. All 
    contributions included in the Rmetrics packages are expected to exist 
    under an open source license such as GPL2. The reasons for this 
    commitment are the ability to test, to extend and to improve the 
    software in a convenient way, to encourage excellent scientific 
    computing and statistical practice in financial engineering and 
    computational finance, and to provide a workbench of tools that allow 
    to explore and expand the methods used to analyze financial market

    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">In the financial 
    community and also in my lectures Windows is the mostly used 
    operating system. To teach financial engineers it became quite 
    natural for me to work under Windows. For a broad distribution and 
    acceptance of Rmetrics I decided to devellop the software under 
    Windows 2000/XP. That is business reality, and it was a good decision.</FONT></FONT></P>
   <P>
    <FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,Monaco"><FONT SIZE="2">There are no many 
    people behind Rmetrics, currently it's only me. I have my job as a 
    lecturer at the Institute of Theoretical Physics at <A HREF="http://www.itp.phys.ethz.ch">ETH
     Zurich</A>, and I'm the senior partner of an ETH spin-off software 
    company, <A HREF="http://www.finance.ch">Finance Online</A>. So I 
    have several responsibilities to take, and as a consequence things 
    might go slow ... The growing Rmetrics collection is based on many 
    statistical and financial functions which were contributed by myself, 
    my students, or were ported from many other sources during the last 
    seven years since I started my lectures in &quot;Econophysics&quot; 
    at ETH. I'm aware that the work is by far not complete. Parts of the 
    software are still untested, and may contain some bugs. Contributors 
    are welcome!</FONT></FONT></P>
